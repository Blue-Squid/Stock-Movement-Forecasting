# Stock-Movement-Forecasting
stock movement prediction using Convolution Neural Network and Classification model with Keras &amp; Tensorboard.

The models attempt to forecast stock movements indicating an upward or downward trend. The back testing algorithm along with other stock indicators project capital for a given period.

Model 1: Base model built using SciKitLearn package uses Logistic Regression to classify stock movement.

Model 2: Convolution Neural Network model built on Keras 2.0.

Tensorboard coming up soon.
